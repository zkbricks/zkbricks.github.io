  In this blog we discuss some recent advances in threshold cryptography, with a particular focus on avoiding distributed key generation (DKG). We also briefly touch upon how threshold cryptography can be used to achieve mempool privacy in blockchains.

Consider the poster child example of threshold cryptography: _threshold encryption_. A user wants to encrypt a message to a quorum of $n$ users such that any set of $t$ users can decrypt the resulting ciphertext, but no set of $t-1$ users can do so. Importantly, the ciphertext is *succinct*: it does not grow with $n$ (or $t$).

Traditionally, without assuming a trusted dealer, this is achieved by a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol, where a global secret key is collectively generated by the quorum of users such that each user has a share of the secret key. 

DKG works, but it brings its own engineering and security headaches: multiple rounds, complex failure modes, identifying who misbehaved, dealing with churn/asynchrony. Furthermore, DKG fixes the quorum of users and the threshold, making them effectively static. In scenarios, such as blockchains (as we elaborate below), where the quorum should evolve dynamically, it is undesirable to run a DKG each time there is a change. This is exactly the “setup tax” that makes threshold cryptography harder to deploy at scale.


### Silent Setup

*Silent setup*, introduced by Garg, Kolonelos, Policharla, and Wang[^1], aims to remove exactly this barrier by replacing interactive setup with a _non-interactive_ procedure. Instead of running a DKG, each user simply generates a public/secret key pair $(\mathsf{pk},\mathsf{sk})$ locally and publishes $\mathsf{pk}$. That is the entire setup. 

Now, a sender who wants to encrypt a message can choose a quorum and threshold _on the fly_, and derive an encryption key for that quorum using only the published public keys of its members. Any $t$ members of the chosen quorum can then collaborate to decrypt, as before. 



### Batched Threshold Encryption

Another advancement of threshold encryption is due to the work of Choudhuri, Garg, Piet and Policharla [^2], who introduce the notion of a batched threshold encryption (BTE). To describe this, we first complete our prior description of a threshold encryption scheme, namely the decryption process. Each user in the quorum, upon receiving a ciphertext, locally computes the *partial decryption*. For a threshold $t$, any $t$ such partial decryptions from users in the quorum can be combined to decrypt the ciphertext.

In a setting where a set of $B$ ciphertexts are encrypted to the same quorum, BTE requires that the size of each partial decryption _does not_ depend on $B$. Such schemes can be used to build an *encrypted mempool* in the blockchain setting: users encrypt their transactions under a quorum, and once a set of transactions is selected for inclusion in a block, a threshold of miners can collaboratively decrypt them by broadcasting partial decryptions. Crucially, these partial decryptions remain small, independent of the number of selected transactions.

BTE has since seen improvements[^3], and a recent work[^4] obtains a BTE scheme that also supports silent setup.
