  <p class="jellyk-hero-tagline">Cryptography for privacy, safety, and trust in digital systems.</p>
  <p class="lead jellyk-hero-desc">We translate cutting-edge advances in cryptography into practical tools. By working at the boundary between theory and deployment, we aim to ensure that financial applications and AI systems are built with privacy, security, and safety at their core. Completely open-source, public goods.</p>
